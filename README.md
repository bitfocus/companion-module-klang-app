# companion-module-klang-app
This app is for remote control of the Klang application. If you're looking for control of the Klang proccessor, see the [companion-module-klang-immersive](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-klang-immersive) module.

## Getting started

Execute `yarn` command to install the dependencies.

The module can be built once with `yarn build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `yarn dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.
